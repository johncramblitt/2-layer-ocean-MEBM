**Code for a transient 2-layer moist energy balance model designed by John Cramblitt, Samuel Richard, and Vlad Munteanu for ATM S 380 (Weather and Climate Prediction).** Solves zonal-mean temperature and hydrologic cycle anomalies through time. Code adapted from materials provided by Dr. Kyle Armour (University of Washington). Couples the following two models:

1) 2-layer Ocean
(Geoffroy et al. 2013)

2) Moist energy balance model w/ paramaterization of the Hadley circulation
(Siler et al. 2018)
